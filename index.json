You can open and edit it in any text editor. It is widely used for writing documentation and README files.\nSyntax. Paragraph A paragraph is one or more consecutive lines of text separated by one or more empty lines. If a string contains only spaces or tabs, it is still considered empty.\nConsecutive lines will be glued into one, if you do not add a hard transfer. There are several ways to do this:\nadd two (or more) spaces at the end of \u0026lt; \u0026gt;\u0026lt; \u0026gt;; add a backslash at the end of the line ; add an HTML line wrap tag .\nHeadings Markdown offers two styles of writing headings: through lattices (#) and through underscores (====). You can use up to six levels of headings, but underscores only allow you to create the first two ( and ).\n🤓 In English-language sources, the terms Atx-style (for lattices) and Setext-style (for underscores) are used to indicate the styles of writing headings.\nGrilles Grilles (Atx-style) Copy the link to the section “Lattices (Atx-style)” In order to select the title, you need to put from 1 to 6 bars (#) and a space at the very beginning of the line. The level of the header depends only on the number of lattices.\nUnderscores (Setext-style) “Underlining” a paragraph with equal signs (=) or hyphens (-) makes it the title of the first or second level, respectively. The level of the header depends only on the type of “dashes”, their number does not matter.\nThere should be no empty lines between the text and the underline.\nLists. Marked To create bulleted (unnumbered) lists, you need to put a minus (-), plus (+) or an asterisk (*) before each item. The marker and the text of the paragraph must be separated by a space. If there are different markers in front of the items in a row, then after the conversion we will get different lists.\nOrdered If we use numbers with a dot at the end (1., 2., etc.) as markers, we will get an ordered (numbered) list. The item numbers in the final markup will go in order (1, 2, 3), even if markdown will be 1., 4., 9.. This feature allows us to use “lazy numbering”, when the same number is placed before each item. The number before the first item shows where to start numbering the list items, so if you put 99., 22. in Markdown, then in the final markup the items will be under the numbers 99, 100, 101. 1.\nNesting Any lists can be nested within each other, for this you need to put a tab or several spaces in front of the marker. The number of spaces you need to use to nest one list within another can vary. It depends on the number of characters in the parent marker (L):\n— 1 character (L = 1) — 2 characters (L = 2) — 3 characters (L = 3) Before the nested list, you need to put from L + 1 to L + 4 spaces. Quotes If you put a triangular bracket (\u0026gt;) at \u0026gt; the line, Markdown will turn the text after it into a quote. Inside can be any blocks: paragraphs, headlines or even other quotes.\nSource code Markdown allows you to mark up the source code in a special way, all characters inside will be automatically escaped. There are 3 ways how this can be done:\nWrap the code with one or two pairs of backsticks (код) Wrap the code with three or more pairs of backsticks (код) Put a tab or 4 spaces before each line of code\nOne or two pairs of backsticks This method allows you to insert the source code as a lowercase element. Even if we actually have a few lines of code wrapped in backsticks, we will still get one line after converting to HTML.\nThree or more pairs of backsticks If we wrap one line of code with three or more pairs of backsticks, we get a lowercase element, and if there are several lines, then a block element. The second option allows you to specify the programming language that we use, for this we need to write it immediately after the opening backsticks.\nAfter designating the programming language, nothing will change visually, but this will allow additional plug-ins and scripts to highlight the code inside the block.\nIndentation Another way to highlight the code is to put a tab or 4 spaces in front of it. The source code must be separated by an empty line from the previous block.\nSelect text If you wrap text with asterisks (*) or underscores (_), it becomes bold or italic. Both characters work the same way, the selection style depends only on their number:\none pair * or _ will make the text italic; two * or _ will make the text bold; three * or _ will apply both styles***.\nTo escape markdown service characters, you need to put a backslash before each of them (*, _, **).\nStandardization Markdown has an original specification from one of the language’s creators, John Gruber. Unfortunately, it doesn’t always unambiguously describe the syntax, which is why many Markdown converters work differently. To remedy this situation, a group of “Markdown fans” created CommonMark, a specification that describes many special cases, and a reference implementation of the …","date":1680393600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1680393600,"objectID":"a0ade9b4b218a8a455292eee739b86e8","permalink":"https://example.com/post/markdown/","publishdate":"2023-04-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/markdown/","section":"post","summary":"This post is about how to write on Markdown","tags":["Markdown"],"title":"Markdown","type":"post"},{"authors":["Irina"],"categories":["week"],"content":"import libr print(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;) Overview Here’s what I did last week\nI passed 2 labs: programming and operating systems\nWrote a math analysis and English test\nWorked about 30 hours\nWent to training 2 times\nStarted reading a new book about finance\n","date":1678924800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1678924800,"objectID":"d3d77bd7a86419217f93d307f0d0e074","permalink":"https://example.com/post/1-post/","publishdate":"2023-03-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/1-post/","section":"post","summary":"Welcome 👋 We know that first impressions are important, so we've populated your new site with some initial content to help you get familiar with everything in no time.","tags":["1 post"],"title":"How was my last week","type":"post"},{"authors":["Irina"],"categories":["study"],"content":"import libr print(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;) About the version control system What is a “version control system” and why is it important? A version control system is a system that writes changes to a file or set of files over time and allows you to return to a specific version later. For file version control, this book will use the source code of the software as an example, although in fact you can use version control for almost any type of file.\nIf you are a graphic or web designer and want to save each version of the image or layout (most likely, you will want), the version control system (hereinafter referred to as SCR) is just what you need. It allows you to return files to the state they were in before the changes, return the project to its original state, see the changes, see who last changed something and caused the problem, who set the task and when, and much more. Using SCR also means in general that if you break something or lose files, you can easily fix it. On top of that, you’ll get it all without any extra effort.\nLocal version control systems Many people use copying files to a separate directory (perhaps even a time-stamped directory if they are smart enough) as a version control method. This approach is very common because of its simplicity, but it is incredibly prone to errors. You can easily forget which directory you are in and accidentally change the wrong file or copy the wrong files.\nIn order to solve this problem, programmers long ago developed local VCS with a simple database that stores records of all changes in files, thereby controlling audits.\nOne of the popular SCR was the RCS system, which is still distributed today with many computers. RCS stores sets of patches (differences between files) on disk in a special format, using which it can recreate the state of each file at a given point in time.\nCentralized version control systems The next major problem that people face is the need to interact with other developers. In order to deal with it, centralized version control systems (CSCR) were developed. Systems such as CVS, Subversion, and Perforce use a single server containing all versions of files, and a number of clients that retrieve files from this centralized repository. The application of CSCR has been the standard for many years.\nThis approach has many advantages, especially over local SLE. For example, all the developers of the project to some extent know what each of them does. Administrators have full control over who can do what, and it is much easier to administer CSCR than it is to operate on-premises databases on each tenant.\nDespite this, this approach also has serious drawbacks. The most obvious disadvantage is a single point of failure, represented by a centralized server. If this server goes down for an hour, then during this time no one will be able to use version control to save the changes they are working on, nor will anyone be able to share these changes with other developers. If the hard disk on which the central database is stored is damaged, and there are no timely backups, you will lose everything - the entire history of the project, except for single snapshots of the repository that were saved on the local machines of the developers. Local SLE suffers from the same problem: when the entire history of the project is stored in one place, you risk losing everything.\nDistributed version control systems This is where distributed version control systems (RSKV) come into play. In RSCV (such as Git, Mercurial, Bazaar, or Darcs), clients don’t just download a snapshot of all files (the state of files at a specific point in time) — they copy the repository entirely. In this case, if one of the servers through which the developers exchanged data dies, any client repository can be copied to another server to continue. Each copy of the repository is a complete backup of all data.\nMoreover, many RSCs can interact with multiple remote repositories at the same time, so you can work with different groups of people using different approaches at the same time within the same project. This allows you to apply several approaches at once in the development, for example, hierarchical models, which is completely impossible in centralized systems.\nResource https://git-scm.com/book/ru/v2/Введение-О-системе-контроля-версий\n","date":1678924800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1678924800,"objectID":"d6b53d062dd0007dc3a664bdd56d238a","permalink":"https://example.com/post/version-control-system/","publishdate":"2023-03-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/version-control-system/","section":"post","summary":"This post is about how to get started with Git.
